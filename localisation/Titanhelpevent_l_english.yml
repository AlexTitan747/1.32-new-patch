 string_MOD_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "This is a help event for Titan Mod, of note with regards to differing from Vanilla:\n -The penalty for wrong / not-accepted culture is twice as much.\n -Idea groups (and policies) are different.\n -There is an economic golden era in the age bonuses that is available for a small time frame in each different age (make sure you save up and don't forget to grab it).\n -Bankrupcy doesn't hurt quite as much in that less prestige is lost and stability is §R-1§! rather than §R-3§!.\n -There is a national recovery act available once per age after a war and a certain loan threshold in the decisions.\n -You can only state provinces in your region or if you have permanent claims on the area or if you (or a subject) owns the whole state.\n -There are new buildings and trade goods, some goods can be upgraded by buildings, scrolling down in the buildings menu will allow you to see what the buildings are, what they can upgrade etc, some require that you have two goods to make one thing and you will need the same number of this second good as you seek to make of this new good e.g. to make 5 bronze you will need 5 copper provinces (to place the building on) and 5 tin provinces too.\n -There is no dev edict (it's included automatically for all cores).\n -Manpower edict is done through decisions.\n -High crownland has a few more benefits compared to vanilla\n -Priviliges don't take away from max absolutism\b -Army professionalism 'milestones' have more benefits"

 string_ETH_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@ETH §BEthiopian Notes:§!\nThe additional Cawa modifier for some reason (pdx why) uses decimial notation rather than percentage for display, so if a modifier says additional cawa:§G +0.25§! this means additional cawa:§G +25%§!."

 string_MOR_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@MOR §BMoroccan Notes:§!\nYou can get a bonus modifier if you are fighting a §Ydefensive§! war with Castille, have no allies and either are a defensive war with Naples or Portugal (this can be the same war as the Castille war). This will expire in 1490, look in your triggered modifiers (bottom right) for more info on what it can do."

 string_NAP_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@NAP §BNaples Notes:§!\nNaples has 3 mutually exclusive formables- Italy, Ilyria and Scilian Empirates (can later form Carthage), the Scilian Empirates is the formable that's usually the 'goto' to form and it's missions can be found at the bottom of your mission tree, it encourages you to delve into Africa across the straight. §TA Royal Coup§! will cause another event in a little while after it's clicked to allow you to form the nation."

 string_SRV_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@SRV §BShirvan Notes:§!\nShirvan has 4 'long term' formables\n-Transcaucasia, this is an 'inbetween' tag, with some upgrades to your national ideas and gaining the ability to get a dev cost reduction on mountains privilige\n-Babylon, this is an infantry shock nation, in order to form it you will need to go Zoroastrian in the change religion event from the §J'A Question Of Faith'§! mission, and then fulfill the requirements of the §M'Babylon'§! mission, this mission cannot be completed but once the requirements are met an event will fire and unlock some of the locked missions and unlock the Babylon formable, forming Babylon will then grant additional (currently hidden) missions in your mission tree\n-Persia, a nation which unsurprisingly centers around conquering Persia and wielding the riches within, you will need to go Zoroastrian in the change religion event from the §J'A Question Of Faith'§! mission, Afghanistan also has access to this formable with the same requirements.\n-Cossack Federation, a cavalry centric tag, you will need to go Orthodox in the change religion event from the §J'A Question Of Faith'§! mission and eliminate Crimea, once you then fulfill the requirements of the §MCossack Federation§! mission an event will fire unlocking the formable and some of the locked missions in your mission tree.\n-The Caliphate, if you choose to go Shia in the change religion event from the §J'A Question Of Faith'§! mission then you can try to form the Caliphate by conquering and converting enough provinces, this formable is available to other muslim countries so don't be too slow, though it will require them to convert to Shia to do so."

 string_AFG_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@AFG §BAfghanistan Notes:§!\nThe Persia formable is shared with Shirvan, if they get the provinces first they will be able to form it."

 string_BOH_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@BOH §BBohemia Notes:§!\nThe 'common' formable is The Kingdom Of Samo which requires that you go Hussite through the events, the other option is to stay Catholic initially and try to form Prussia"

 string_MER_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@MEW §BMewar Notes:§!\nFor some reason Rajput force limit is diplayed as Cossack forcelimit, this is a vanilla issue and I can't fix it, if you see any modifier for Cossack forcelimit then read it as rajput focelimit"

 string_BNG_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@BNG §BBengal Notes:§!\nFor some reason Rajput force limit is diplayed as Cossack forcelimit, this is a vanilla issue and I can't fix it, if you see any modifier for Cossack forcelimit then read it as rajput focelimit"

 string_CRI_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@CRI §BCrimea Notes:§!\nYou are able to integrate tributaries, also through the mission tree you can get an automatic annexation of Zaporozhie and Chernigov if they are tributaries, (if they are normal non-tributary subjects you will get diplomatic annexation cost). Compared to vanilla there are additional sources of Horde unity such as having a happy tribes estate, having a happy noyans estate or power projection, as well as a mission reward in the bottom right section of your mission tree. Also, razing has been disabled from Hordes."

 string_ENG_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@ENG §BEngland (/@HLA House Of Lancaster) Notes:§!\nYou will get an event a little bit after the start of the game which will give you province war score cost to allow you to annex all of the House of York, also, after annexing in a peace deal you will get another event a month later which will give you free cores on all of York's old land so you do not need to spend admin coring it."

 string_HUN_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@HUN §BHungary Notes:§!\nHungary will get an event sometime after the start of the game with the option to switch national ideas from cavalry combat ability to infantry combat ability, this is the advised option and is a neccessary option for unlocking the Carpathia formable (infantry focussed small upgrade to national ideas which is relatively easy to form), if the idea change is not taken and the cavalry combat ability is kept then the only formable available is Austria-Hungary which requires that you take the HRE path in the event that happens after completing the mission §YKingdom Consolidation§! and requires you to take most of Austria and Bohemia and in general go into the HRE, this is a difficult path and the formable is unlocked much later on."

 string_POR_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@POR §BPortugal Notes:§!\nPortugal has 2 versions of the Portugese Empire formable, one focuses on colonising Africa and has slightly stronger ideas, the other focuses on colonising South America and has slightly weaker ideas (of the two versions). Doing the Africa variation will still allow you to establish colonies in South America and Indonesia but will annex the South African colony, doing the South American variation will annex all South American colonies (Carribean does not count) and will prevent forming any new colonies in any region."

 string_OMA_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "@OMA §BOman Notes:§!\nOman has 3 formable nations, each linked with a different Muslim denomination; Sunni for Arabia which is a cavalry tag, Ibadi for Omani Empire which has a focus on colonising India and Indonesia and mercenaries, and Shia for the Caliphate which is a blobbing tag which rewards having a lot of provinces (with enough they can double their nation idea modifiers), though other Muslim countries can form the Caliphate too if they have enough provinces."
