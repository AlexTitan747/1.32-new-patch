 string_MOD_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "This is a help event for Titan Mod, of note with regards to differing from Vanilla:\n -Wrong / not-accepted culture hurts twice as much.\n -Idea groups are different, have a look around when you get a chance.\n -There is an economic golden era in the age bonuses that is available for a small time frame in each different age (make sure you save up and don't forget to grab it).\n -Bankrupcy doesn't hurt quite as much in that less prestige is lost and stability is §R-1§! rather than §R-3§!.\n -There is a national recovery act available once per age after a war and a certain loan threshold in the decisions.\n -You can only state provinces in your region or if you have permanent claims on the area or if you (or a subject) owns the whole state.\n -There are new buildings and trade goods, some goods can be upgraded by buildings, scrolling down in the buildings menu will allow you to see what the buildings are, what they can upgrade etc, some require that you have two goods to make one thing and you will need the same number of this second good as you seek to make of this new good e.g. to make 5 bronze you will need 5 copper provinces (to place the building on) and 5 tin provinces.\n -There is no dev edict (it's included automatically for all cores).\n -Manpower edict is done through decisions.\n"

 string_ETH_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "§BEthiopian notes:§!\nThe additional Cawa modifier for some reason (pdx why) uses decimial notation rather than percentage for display, so if a modifier says additional cawa:§G +0.25§! this means additional cawa:§G +25%§!."

 string_MOR_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "§BMoroccan notes:§!\nYou can get a bonus modifier if you are fighting a §Ydefensive§! war with Castille, have no allies and either are a defensive war with Naples or Portugal (this can be the same war as the Castille war). This will expire in 1490, look in your triggered modifiers (bottom right) for more info on what it can do."

 string_NAP_HELP_EVENT_Text:0 "§BNaples notes:§!\nNaples has 3 mutually exclusive formables: Italy, Ilyria and Scilian Empirates (can later form Carthage), the Scilian Empirates is the formable that's usually the 'goto' to form and it's missions can be found at the bottom of your mission tree, it encourages you to delve into Africa across the straight. §TA Royal Coup§! will cause another event in a little while after it's clicked to allow you to form the nation."
