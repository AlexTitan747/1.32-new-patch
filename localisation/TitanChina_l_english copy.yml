 chinagov.title1:0 "The Question of Power"
 chinagov.desc1:0 "After the fall of the Ming dynasty the time has come to decide who will rule our great state. This will matter much as our new government will decide the way our nation will develop, will we expand and prosper or will we be forgotten in the passage of time. This will decide the balance of power for future generations. Will we be ruled by a duke, our confucian monks or a federation of mercantile traders?"

Therefore the time has come for change, the people are no longer satisfied with our government. In order to expand and prosper as we once did we must forge a new way forward and provide opertunities to our people. So once again we must choose, will we be ruled by a king, A leading religeous figure or a group of powerful traders?"

However despite this it is chaos on the streets, the people care not about our size they only care for their rights. As the bells of revolution begin to toll we know in order to keep our empire together in a way no other dynasty has ever managed we must follow the people's will. So for the final time in our state's expansive and great history we must decide what is best for the people now and on into the future. What will the people decide? Will they be ruled by a great celestial monarch? Our greatest Confucian monk with the closest connection to the world around us? Or the men who provide us prosperity, the great traders of our cities who's financial prowess is no match for anyone else in asia?"
