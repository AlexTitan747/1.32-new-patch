 recovery_from_the_mongol_invasion_desc: "In the midst of the 1300s, as the once great Mongol Empire was split up and the successor states were tearing themselves apart, Bukhara was still feeling the ravages of what the Mongols did to the city. We must never forget how these scars on our heart came to be, but we must also not let them bind us into the past; we must recover and become a prosperous center of culture, art, learning, and trade for all of Central Asia just as we once were."

 intellect_center_of_the_islamic_world_desc: "After the fall of the Sogdians and with the rise of influential Caliphates in the south, Bukhara experiences a golden age of sorts under the Samanids. During the time of the Samanids, Bukhara's people may have still worshipped idols at times along with others following Islam, but their work at building Bukhara up made it into an intellectual center of the Islamic world. If we are to truly succeed our past, we must meet this legacy and transcend it with our work in all facets of the state, whether it be in religion, in politics, or in society itself."
 improve_public_education: "Improve Public Education"
 improve_public_education_desc: "Steppe life did not readily allow for us to educate the populace like we would want. We have seen what kind of marvels settled life can bring and what achievements in thought and innovation the public can bring about if they are educated enough; indeed much of the Persian heartland and its history is an example of this and we would do well to follow this example and begin large efforts to improve the education of the Bukharan populace."
 settling_from_the_steppe: "Settling from the Steppe"
 settling_from_the_steppe_desc: "In no way is it easy to go from nomadic and semi-nomadic steppe life to settled life; the culture of the people changes and so to does the politics that stem from them. We are not without experience in this matter, however, as we have been attempting to handle this matter for decades now and will continue to do so as time goes on. There is no panacea to this drastic change in life styles for thousands upon thousands of people, but our administrative efforts can certainly attempt to help them out."
 utilizing_fire_and_shock: "Fire and Shock"
 utilizing_fire_and_shock_desc: "If there is one thing that Bukhara will need for its survival, it is a strong military sector. Protecting the archives and scholars and attracting more requires safe passage and safe cities, no? Therefore we must not stay stagnant in our ways of the past with largely cavalry-based armies that use shock tactics primarily. We should be looking to modernize and adapt our weapons so that we can compete with other states around us, but also we must recognize that our traditional fighting style still does offer advantages in certain situations. Much like how Bukhara is a merging of cultures and traditions, it can be the sight of merging fighting styles."
 persian_cannoneer_experience: "Persian Cannoneers"
 persian_cannoneer_experience_desc: "The Persian people, though at times hostile to us and at other times friendly to us, are skilled in their usage of new weapons, especially the larger caliber ones that are found in sieges and extensive military engagements. We have reports that they have frequently used them against the Turks of the west in Mesopotamia and Anatolia, so perhaps hiring and recruiting Persian soldiers who specialize in cannons can do us good."
 patronize_learning_and_arts: "Patronize Scholars and Artists"
 patronize_learning_and_arts_desc: "Much like our old self, Bukhara is blossoming into a place of artistic brilliance and scholarly wonder. From madrasahs to mosques to temples to palatial estates, we have a myriad of places that are attracting great people from not only the Islamic world, but also other places too. From poets to physicians to traders and more, Bukhara is once again becoming a source of life and light for the entirety of Central Asia."
