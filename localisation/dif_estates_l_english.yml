 estate_janissaries_desc: "This estate represents the Janissary caste, an elite military unit originating in the Ottoman Empire which was instituted through the devshirme system of child slavery, by which young Christian boys were forcibly taken from their families, enslaved and converted to Islam, and incorporated into the Ottoman army.\n\nThey became famed for internal cohesion cemented by strict discipline and order. Unlike typical slaves, they are paid regular salaries. Forbidden to marry before the age of 40 or engage in trade, their complete loyalty to the Sultan is expected."
